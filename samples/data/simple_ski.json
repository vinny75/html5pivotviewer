From the massive rock outcrop of the Gruppo del Sella, the four valleys of Val Gardena, Val di Fassa, Val di Alta Badia and Val di Livinallongo, wind their way through the extensive Dolomite range and provide some spectacular scenery. The Sella Ronda circuit represents the largest interconnected ski area in the Dolomites and links all four of the valleys, plus the resorts of Campitello, Canazei, Selva, Ortisei, Colfosco, Corvara, La Villa and Arabba, with modern, efficient lift systems, exceptionally well-groomed pistes and Arabba's very own extensive artificial snow-making equipment. Arabba is one of the most famous resorts on the circuit - a small, traditional village perched at the top of Val Livinallongo, occupying one of the best positions for keen skiers, with the pistes in Arabba leading right back to the village.
